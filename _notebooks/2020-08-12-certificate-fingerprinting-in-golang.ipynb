To do so, it relies on a public key certificate associated with the domain name and issued by a certificate authority (CA) which acts as a trusted third party. I'm using github pages to host this page. Looking at the certificate in Brave's certificate viewer, you see github pages uses lets encrypt as the CA. (If you are looking at this tutorial after November 4th, 2020, you'll see different values.)"

    "Looking at the same viewer, you'll also notice that Brave shows two fingerprints: one for the (no longer secure) SHA-1 algorithm and the other for the SHA256, a 512 bit block hash in the SHA-2 family. If you aren't doing much work with public key cryptography, this may be the first time you noticed the fingerprint section. However, if you use computers in any sophisticated capacity, you've probably probably have seen hashes of public key artifacts in other contexts. In particular, you may have seen a message like this, \n",

    "when connecting to a new SSH host using OpenSSH. This user experience is called TOFU: Trust on First Use. Since SSH has not seen this key before (or rather, it's fingerprint) it prompts you whether or not you would like to trust it. If you confirm with `y`, future sessions won't prompt you again, so long as the fingerprint of the key does not change. \n",

    "While [TOFU is a questionable practice](https://smallstep.com/blog/use-ssh-certificates/) with respect to security (how often do you actually confirm the fingerprint with an administrator or in some database before confirmation?), this use of fingerprinting is common in applications using TLS. This notebook shows you how to use both OpenSSL and golang to extract equivalent fingerprints. It is fully self-contained â€” if you have a Golang kernel for Jupyter, you can run it."
